# Spring Zeebe Example

Uses [the Spring Zeebe SDK](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/spring-zeebe-sdk/getting-started/#add-the-spring-zeebe-sdk-to-your-project) to interact with a local self-managed Camunda installation. The interactions with Zeebe are:

1. Deploy a process model.
2. Initiate a process instance.
3. Handle a service task.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- A code editor

### Steps

1. Install Camunda desktop modeler
   from https://camunda.com/download/modeler/
2. Install self-managed
   (from https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform?tab=readme-ov-file#using-docker-compose)
   1. Confirm launched in Docker Desktop, under `camunda-platform` Container.
   2. Confirm by logging into operate (http://localhost:8081) with `demo`/`demo`.
3. Create a new Spring Boot project
   (from https://start.spring.io/)
   1. Project: Maven
   2. Language: Java
   3. Spring Boot: latest non-SNAPSHOT (currently 3.3.0)
   4. Project Metadata:
      1. Group: `com.your-choice`
      2. Artifact: `handle-payment`
      3. Name: `Handle Payment
      4. Description: `Handle payment process with Camunda`
      5. Package name: `com.your-choice.handlepayment`
      6. Packaging: `Jar`
      7. Java: 17
   5. Dependencies: none
   6. "Generate" and download the project
      1. `mvn spring-boot:run` to confirm it builds
      2. `git init` if you'd like to commit milestones along the way.
4. Create a new BPMN diagram
   1. Open Camunda desktop modeler
   2. Create a new diagram
      1. Rename process to "handle-payment"
   3. Add a start event
      1. Name: "Payment request received"
   4. Add a task
      1. Name: "Prepare transaction"
      2. Type: "script"
      3. Implementation: "FEEL expression"
      4. Script/Result variable: totalWithTax
      5. Script/FEEL expression: `total * 1.1`
   5. Add a task
      1. Name: "Charge credit card"
      2. Type: "Service task"
      3. Task definition/Type: "charge-credit-card"
   6. Add an end event
      1. Name: "Payment executed"
   7. Save file to project location
      1. Location: `src/main/resources`
      2. Name: `handle-payment.bpmn`
5. Deploy process to self-managed installation
   1. Click "rocket" icon in Camunda desktop modeler
   2. Deployment name: "handle-payment"
   3. Target: "Camunda 8 Self-Managed"
   4. Cluster endpoint: "http://localhost:26500/"
   5. Authentication: "None"
   6. Deploy
   7. Confirm deployment in operate (dashboard shows "Handle Payment" process)
6. Run process from Modeler
   1. Click "play" icon in Camunda desktop modeler
   2. Variables: `{"total": 100}`
   3. Start
   4. Confirm process instance in operate
      1. Stuck in "Charge credit card" task, because we aren't handling that service task yet
      2. Confirm variables: `{"total": 100, "totalWithTax": 110}`
7. Implement service task

   1. "Install" Camunda Spring Boot Starter
      (see https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/spring-zeebe-sdk/getting-started/#add-the-spring-zeebe-sdk-to-your-project)
      1. Add repository to pom.xml (see docs)
      2. Add dependency to pom.xml (see docs)
   2. Configure Zeebe client

      1. src/main/resources/application.properties

         ```
         zeebe.client.broker.grpcAddress=http://127.0.0.1:26500
         zeebe.client.broker.restAddress=http://127.0.0.1:8080
         zeebe.client.security.plaintext=true
         ```

         _Note:_ these URLs are `http`, not `https`. The docs tell us `https`, but that gets overridden in the SDK by the fact that `plaintext`is true.`http` is a more accurate reflection of your local self-managed environment, which does not have TLS/https configured.

   3. Create a worker
      1. src/main/java/com/your-choice/handle_payment
         1. Name: `ChargeCreditCardWorker`
         2. Package: `com.your-choice.handlepayment`
         3. Decorate class with `@Component`
         4. Decorate `chargeCreditCard` method with `@JobWorker`
         5. Specify `@Variable(name = "totalWithTax") Double totalWithTax` argument into `chargeCreditCard` method
         6. Implement `chargeCreditCard` method
            1. Log "Charging credit card" and amount
            2. Return a map containing the amount charged (this also marks the task as complete)
      2. Confirm credit card charge
         1. In console output
         2. In operate
   4. Start a process instance

      1. Instantiate a static logger in `HandlePaymentApplication.java`:

         ```java
         private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HandlePaymentsApplication.class);
         ```

      2. Declare an autowired `ZeebeClient` in `HandlePaymentApplication.java`:

         ```java
         @Autowired
         private ZeebeClient zeebeClient;
         ```

      Two options for implementation. I'll try to track down which is more idiomatic for Spring developers. For now, here are both of them.

      1. Implement a CommandLineRunner

         1. In `HandlePaymentApplication.java`, add `implements CommandLineRunner` to the class declaration: `public class HandlePaymentApplication implements CommandLineRunner {`
         2. Implement an overriding `run` method:

            ```java
            @Override
            public void run(final String... args) {
              var processDefinitionKey = "handle-payment"; // or whatever the key is
              var event = zeebeClient.newCreateInstanceCommand()
                  .bpmnProcessId(processDefinitionKey)
                  .latestVersion()
                  .variables(Map.of("total", 100))
                  .send()
                  .join();
              LOG.info(String.format("started a process: %d", event.getProcessInstanceKey()));
            }
            ```

      2. Implement a @PostConstruct method

         1. In `HandlePaymentApplication.java`, add `@PostConstruct` to a new method called `init`:

            ```java
            @PostConstruct
            public void init() {
              var processDefinitionKey = "handle-payment-final";
              var event = zeebeClient.newCreateInstanceCommand()
                  .bpmnProcessId(processDefinitionKey)
                  .latestVersion()
                  .variables(Map.of("total", 100))
                  .send()
                  .join();
              LOG.info(String.format("started a process: %d", event.getProcessInstanceKey()));
            }
            ```

      3. Confirm the process starts by re-running the app
         1. Confirm output in console
         2. Confirm process instance in operate

   5. Deploy the process on startup

      1. Add `@Deployment(resources = "classpath:handle-payment.bpmn")` to `HandlePaymentsApplication.java`
      2. Change the tax amount calculated in Camunda Modeler to `total * 1.2`
      3. Restart the app and confirm the updated process is deployed and executed
         1. Confirm in console output
         2. Confirm process instance in operate
